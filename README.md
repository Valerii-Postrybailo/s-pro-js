1. Write a function that returns true if the given argument is a number.

2. Write a function that displays the message "Passed" on the screen if the argument passed is less than 10 and greater than 2.

3. Implement two functions: the first function should divide the argument "a" by the argument "b". If the argument "b" is zero, the function should throw an error. The second function should call the first and handle the error.

4. Write a function that takes an array of strings as input and returns the number of unique strings.

5. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns their average value. Implement the program in two ways: through loops and through array functions.

6. Write a function that takes an array of strings as input and returns the shortest string. Implement the program in two ways: through loops and through array functions.

7. Implement a program that simulates the work of a university. At a minimum, the following classes must be present: Student, Teacher, University. Implement their interaction.

8. Write a function that displays numbers from 1 to 100 on the screen. At the same time, instead of numbers that are multiples of 3, the program should display the word "Foo", and instead of numbers that are multiples of five, the word "Bar". If the number is a multiple of fifteen, the program should output the word 'FooBar'.
